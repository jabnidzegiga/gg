    <p> <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy <u>text</u> of the printing and typesetting industry</p>
    <p>
    <em><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500,</mark>  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</em></p>
    <p>
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b><del>Aldus PageMaker </del> </b> including versions of Lorem Ipsum
